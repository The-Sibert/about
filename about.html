                        My favorite sportperson is the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa. The image to the left depicts him during his fight with Apollo Creed in the first Rocky-movie. 
                        <br> The second image is him touching gloves with his opponent Ivan Drago in the fourth Rocky-movie.

                        I would very much like to travel to Japan. I think it looks like a very pretty country with rich culture and good food. I would love to eat wuague beef which is made in Japan
